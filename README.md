### About

I am an ISTQB-certified QA engineer with a passion for ensuring quality in software development through test automation and informed manual processes.

I consider quality assurance to be a unique software engineering discipline; I bring a strong background in object-oriented programming and a professional foundation in testing backend API solutions, including distributed systems and microservices.

My expertise extends to shell scripting using Bash, Groovy, and Python to automate tasks and streamline processes for optimal efficiency.

In addition to proficiency in front-end testing tools such as Cypress and Selenium, I possess extensive experience in testing RESTful services, interfacing with both relational and non-relational databases, and processing big data using tools like Pandas and Jupyter.

My journey is deeply integrated with CI/CD, and I thrive in the dynamic atmosphere of agile development environments. I routinely deploy applications and execute smoke, regression, and functional test suites to ensure quality of frequent releases.

Beyond the testing landscape, I'm fascinated by the open-source community and digital audio, reflecting my strong professional background in technology and music.

If you're looking to connect, feel free to find me on GitHub or LinkedIn.
